## Introduction

This UG (Year 3) module builds on the quantitative modules of Year 1 (Probability, Statistics and Modelling I) and Year 2 (Probability, Statistics and Modelling II), and introduces data science techniques as means for more sophisticated quantitative data analysis. This module aims to introduce students to computational methods for crime science.

The techniques covered in this module will be of relevance to students undertaking their final year independent research project. 


## Dates & times

The module is running in Term 2, 2018/2019, from 7 January 2019 - 29 March 2019.

- Lectures: Mondays, 1 - 3pm.
- Tutorials: Tuesdays (in even-numbered academic weeks), 11am - 1pm.

## Learning outcomes

Upon successful completion of this module, you will be able to:

- demonstrate knowledge of a broader range of analytical techniques used in the field of Security and Crime Science
- understand the purpose, advantages and disadvantages of different forms of data science techniques
- perform data science analyses on crime and/or-security related issues
- apply the data science pipeline on crime and/or-security related issues
- interpret and effectively report the results of said techniques

## Structure

The general structure of this module is as follows: you will learn about data science approaches to crime and security problems in the lectures. These will cover the approaches on a conceptual level (what do they do?) and functional level (how do they work?). The tutorials are practical sessions in which you will learn how to implement the techniques of the previous lectures in the R programming language. During the tutorials, we will be there to assist you and help you. As preparation for each tutorial, you will be given homework that helps you consolidate the concepts and build your R skills portfolio.

## Materials

### Software

We will use the R programming language. All packages, required resources and tools needed are openly available and free to download to any computer. We encourage students to bring their own laptops to the tutorials so they can customise their work environment. However, we will have a computer cluster available where you can use the UCL computers.

### Literature

We will provide background reading and literature for each week in advance.

- A resource that we will use throughout and recommend keeping as a go-to guide is Max Kuhn & Kjell Johnson's book [Applied Predictive Modelling](https://www.springer.com/us/book/9781461468486) (in R). You will find this book freely available to you as UCL student through UCL Library's [free e-book access to this book](https://ucl-new-primo.hosted.exlibrisgroup.com/primo-explore/fulldisplay?docid=TN_springer_s978-1-4614-6849-3_216330&context=PC&vid=UCL_VU2&lang=en_US&search_scope=CSCOP_UCL&adaptor=primo_central_multiple_fe&tab=local&query=any,contains,Applied%20Predictive%20Modeling&offset=0).
- An excellent guide to using R for Data Science is the [book with the same title written by Hadley Wickham & Garrett Grolemund](https://r4ds.had.co.nz/), which published online.

### Data

All datasets used are open-source and available without restrictions.

**Class test**

### 25 Mar

_1-on-1 feedback: we will hold the 1-on-1 feedback sessions from 2pm - 5pm (slots to be scheduled individually), see below._

## Assessment

### Class test

- Weight for final grade: 30%
- Learning outcomes tested: (1) demonstrating knowledge of a broader range of analytical techniques used in the field of Security and Crime Science, (2) understanding the purpose, advantages and disadvantages of different forms of data science techniques, (3) interpreting the results of data science techniques.
- Date: 18 March 2019, 1-3pm.

**Details:** This 1-hour closed-book test covers theoretical and conceptual aspects of the lectures and tutorials. You will be given 9 questions to which you are required to write a brief answer. The questions are a mix of multiple-choice and open questions. 


### Applied Data Science Project

**!!! Updated assignment details can be found [here](https://raw.githack.com/ben-aaron188/ucl_aca_20182019/master/assignments/applied_data_science_project.nb.html)**

- Weight for final grade: 70%
- Learning outcomes tested: (1) demonstrating knowledge of a broader range of analytical techniques used in the field of Security and Crime Science, (2) performing data science analyses on crime and/or-security related issues, (3) applying the data science pipeline on crime and/or-security related issues, (4) interpreting and effectively reporting the results of said techniques
- Deadline: 16 April 2019.
- Feedback deadlines: 8 March 2019 for the peer-feedback, 22 March 2019 for the 1-on-1 feedback (see below)
- Word count limit: 2000 words (excl. code supplement; do not exceed this word count limit!)

**Feedback sessions:** Since a full project is a major step in your data science skills career, we will hold two feedback sessions to help you in the process.

1. Peer-feedback session: you will exchange an outline of your project idea (i.e. which problem do you want to address and how?) with a fellow student. The purpose of the peer feedback is to get an independent view on your project early in the process. We will provide templates for the feedback that you will give and receive. The peer-feedback session will be held **at end of the lecture on 11 March. 2019**.

2. 1-on-1 feedback session: you will receive individualised feedback from both Bennett and Felix in a 1-on-1 session where we will help you with questions and give you final advice to fine-tune your project. These sessions will take 10 minutes per student and will be held on **25 March 2019** (timeslots to be arranged). 

**Details:** This assessment is the capstone project of the module. It requires you to address a crime and security science research problem in the full data science workflow (e.g., obtaining the data, processing the data, modelling the data, building predictive models, reporting on the findings, interpreting the outcomes). You will write a brief report on your project (a template will be provided) and you have to submit the R code needed to reproduce your findings. After passing this assessment, you will have the demonstrated the skills to solve a problem using data science techniques.



## Attendance requirement

We are obliged to record the attendance at all sessions (lectures and tutorials) and each student will have to attend at least 70% of the sessions to be able to pass the module. If you cannot attend for a good reason, please let the TA know about this well in advance. *We strongly advise you to attend all sessions as this ease the assessment for you and will help you get the most out of this module.*
