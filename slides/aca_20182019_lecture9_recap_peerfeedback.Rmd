### Case study 1 [(URL)](http://aclweb.org/anthology/D18-1394)

##

<img data-src="./img/sentimentstyles.png">

## Sentiment styles: RQ

Are there patterns in sentiment usage in popular YouTube vlogs?

## Needed

- vlog data
- sentiment "trajectories"
- cluster analysis

## Data pipeline

- retrieved list of most popular vloggers
- excluded those that were no real vloggers and non-English speaking
- scraped transcripts for each vlog
    - 27,333 transcripts
    - 40m tokens
    - 24b views

## Analysis

- unsupervised learning
- k-means method
- assigned each vlog to its cluster

## Findings

- 7 distinct sentiment styles
- preferance was moderated by gender

## Findings

| Cluster            	| Family 	| Female 	| Male   	|
|--------------------	|--------	|--------	|--------	|
| Downhill from here 	| 2.23   	| 1.26   	| -2.88* 	|
| Mood swings        	| -2.31  	| 1.96   	| 1.25   	|
| Rags to riches     	| 2.13   	| -1.95  	| -1.08  	|
| Riches to rags     	| -2.05  	| 4.88*  	| -0.56  	|
| Bump in the road   	| 1.69   	| -1.12  	| -1.08  	|
| End on a high note 	| -5.16* 	| -6.03* 	| 8.32*  	|
| Twin peaks         	| 3.83*  	| 2.25   	| -4.99* 	|

## Findings

- 7 distinct sentiment styles
- preferance was moderated by gender
- no effect on view count
- no effect on vlog length
